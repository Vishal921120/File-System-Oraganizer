//1. First Activity with Node.js

// We will be creating a File System Organizer//
//Features of the Project -
//If you have numerous Files in a folder and they are not Properly arranged
//So you can use this tool to arrange them in specific directory according to their extension
// like text files will go into text File Folder .exe files will go into application folder and so on
// so at the end you will have a arranged set of files in specific folders

// we will be using built in node modules like fs and path to  create this project
// remember to igonore test folder while pushing your code on github

// array ke from mein input jaata hai command line pein

// let input = process.argv[0] // here 2 implies the index 
// console.log(input)// whatever we pass in command line, it will print 2nd index value
// node js treats command line inputs as array and that array is your process array
